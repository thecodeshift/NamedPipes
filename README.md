# Named Pipes

Named pipes implementation for inter-process communication on a Raspberry a Pi

## Getting Started

There are multiple mechanisms to communicate between processes. Here we will show how to do a bidirectional communication through pipes

The repository contains two examples in two diferent languages (C++ and Python)

[Python Implementation](https://github.com/thecodeshift/NamedPipes/tree/master/NamedPipes/Python)

Each project has its own readme to explain the solution setup
